This is a mini-project created by:
Nikita Jain
while completing the coursera course: Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS (https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web)
This project has filters that you can apply to your images which are created using JavaScript.
The green screen algorithm will change any green-screen image's background to the background you provided.
